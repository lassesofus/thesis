\subsubsection{Systematic offset in initial Cartesian error}
Across all axes, the initial Cartesian error deviates slightly from the nominal 20\,cm offset, with measured distances closer to 20--23\,cm. This systematic bias arises from absolute positioning errors in the IK and actuator execution pipeline. While this affects reported absolute distances, it does not alter the qualitative trends across planning steps.
